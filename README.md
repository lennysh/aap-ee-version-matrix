This repository provides a centralized, community-driven tracker for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) Execution Environment package and OS versions. It aims to offer a clear and quick reference for mapping AAP EE's to their corresponding package versions, such as `ansible-core` and `python` as well as their included Ansible collections (with versions) and other packages.

## üìã Data Tables

For easy viewing, the raw data has been converted into a user-friendly Markdown table, which is generated from the central CSV file.
